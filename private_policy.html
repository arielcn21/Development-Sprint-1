		<strong>Last updated 12th May 2020</strong>
		<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

		<p> &emsp;We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the updated Privacy Policy on the Site, and you waive the right to receive specific notice of each such change or modification.</p>

		<p>&emsp;You are encouraged to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed of updates. You will be deemed to have been made aware of, will be subject to, and will be deemed to have accepted the changes in any revised Privacy Policy by your continued use of the Site after the date such revised Privacy Policy is posted.
		</p>
		<!--		 <strong>Legal:</strong>

		<ol class="c1">
		  <li>Downloading copyrighted songs, which have been made available by the artist for free download. In this case the copyright holder is allowing the free distibution of their work by posting it themselves and controlling the distrobution. For example, logging onto Mp3.com and downloading a song by delirious, a popular group from the UK. They have several songs available, which are all copyrighted, for download. However, to stay in the realm of the legal, you must abide by their usage restrictions on the music, which are usually minimal, such as the music is for your personal use only. By downloading these types of music files, you agree to any restrictions there may be on the music.</li>

		  <li>Downloading non-copyrighted songs, that are freely available.<br />
		  </li>

		  <li>Downloading copyrighted music which you "own". For example, I went out and purchased a Bon Jovi compact disc. A few months after I buy the disc, I drop the disc on the ground, and it becomes so scratched it skips when it plays. Since I have already purchased the music, I can get online and download all of the songs which are on that disc, and go ahead and burn a copy for my personal use.<br />
